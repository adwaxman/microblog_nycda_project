1. XXXXX Put feed on home page XXXXX

Issues:

1. How to handle going to "Users" page when not logged in
2. Logic for handling user with less than 10 posts.  Options to display all posts (not just most recent 10)
3. Handling profile if they haven't posted any or enough messages (if statment cuz of feed)

If there's time:

1. change password
2. add mandrill
3. email verification
4.
